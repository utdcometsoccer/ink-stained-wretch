        "description": "How did a kid whose dad lived in the poorhouse become the most successful storyteller in the world? This \"fizzing, funny, often deeply moving\" (Daily Mail) #1 New York Times bestselling memoir is “damn near addictive. I loved it . . . that Patterson guy can write!” (Ron Howard) On the morning he was born, he nearly died. His dad grew up in the Pogey– the Newburgh, New York, poorhouse. He worked at a mental hospital in Massachusetts, where he met the singer James Taylor and the poet Robert Lowell. While he toiled in advertising hell, James wrote the ad jingle line “I’m a Toys ‘R’ Us Kid.” He once watched James Baldwin and Norman Mailer square off to trade punches at a party. He’s only been in love twice. Both times are amazing. Dolly Parton once sang “Happy Birthday” to James over the phone. She calls him J.J., for Jimmy James. How did a boy from small-town New York become the world’s most successful writer? How does he do it? He has always wanted to write the kind of novel that would be read and reread so many times that the binding breaks and the book literally falls apart. As he says, “I’m still working on that one.”",

The perfect life A successful lawyer and loving mother, Nina Bloom would do anything to protect the life she's built in New York--including lying to everyone, even her daughter, about her past. But when an innocent man is framed for murder, she knows that she can't let him pay for the real killer's crimes. The perfect lie Nina's secret life began 18 years ago. She had looks to die for, a handsome police-officer husband, and a carefree life in Key West. When she learned she was pregnant with their first child, her happiness was almost overwhelming. But Nina's world is shattered when she unearths a terrible secret that causes her to run for her life and change her identity. The perfect way to die Now, years later, Nina risks everything she's earned to return to Florida and confront the murderous evil she fled. In a story of wrenching suspense, James Patterson gives us his most head-spinning, action-filled story yet--a Hitchcock-like blend of unquenchable drama and pleasure.",

Two roads lead to Mount Hope. None leads out. A small southern town was evacuated after a freak accident. As the first anniversary of the mishap approaches, some residents are allowed to return past the national guard roadblocks. Mount Hope natives Maggie and Jordan quickly discover that their hometown is not as it was before. Downed cellular networks fail to resume service. Animals savagely attack humans. And the damaged power plant, where Jordan's father is an engineer, is under military lockdown. As friends and family morph into terrifying strangers, Maggie and Jordan increasingly turn to each other. Their determination to discover who -- or what -- has taken control of Mount Hope soon has them caught in the crosshairs of a presence more sinister than any they could have imagined.",

After a nuclear explosion forces the evacuation of his town, Jordan and his family are finally able to return after nearly a year. He hopes to pick up the pieces of his life...but something strange is happening. The entire town is cut off from the internet and TV. Animals are viciously attacking humans. Mysterious people appear out of nowhere. And most alarmingly, the military presence has cordoned off the roads, and no one is allowed to come in--or leave. And something is wrong with Jordan. He's faster, stronger than he ever was before the car accident that occurred during the meltdown. He's changed. And as recovered as their town seems to be, there's an electric undercurrent of fear. Something is happening, even if the military says everything is fine. And Jordan, along with his best friend, Maggie, must discover what really happened during the reactor explosion... before it's too late.",
